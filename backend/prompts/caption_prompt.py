CAPTION_TEMPLATE = """Generate a single social media caption with the following structure:

**HOOK** (first line - must stop the scroll)
- Use a bold statement, question, or controversial take
- Should work on its own if the rest is truncated by the platform

**BODY** (2-4 short paragraphs)
- Deliver value, insight, or a story
- Use line breaks between ideas
- Keep paragraphs to 1-2 sentences max
- Use power words and emotional triggers

**CTA** (call to action)
- Clear, specific action the reader should take
- Examples: "Save this for later", "DM us 'GROWTH'", "Tag a salon owner who needs this"

**HASHTAGS** (5-15 relevant hashtags)
- Mix of branded, niche, and discovery hashtags
- Place on a separate line after the CTA

Platform-specific guidelines:
- Instagram: optimal 150-300 characters body (up to 2200 allowed), 20-30 hashtags acceptable
- TikTok: max 150 characters, 3-5 hashtags
- YouTube Community: up to 500 characters, minimal hashtags

Output the caption as plain text, ready to copy and paste."""
